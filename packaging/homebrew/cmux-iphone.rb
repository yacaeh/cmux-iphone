# Homebrew formula for cmux-iphone.
#
# This formula lives in the tap repo (lim-won/homebrew-tap) at
# Formula/cmux-iphone.rb. On the FIRST release, set the real `sha256` (CI bumps
# `url` + `sha256` automatically on every new tag thereafter via
# mislav/bump-homebrew-formula-action). Forkers: replace `lim-won` with your
# own GitHub username in `homepage`/`url` and the tap repo.
#
# Users then:  brew install lim-won/tap/cmux-iphone && cmux-iphone setup
#
# The release tarball is the self-contained bridge package (bridge/ + setup.sh +
# setup-hooks.sh) with node_modules vendored (the only dep, bonjour-service, is
# pure JS, so no per-machine compile).

    libexec.install Dir["*"]

  # `brew services start cmux-iphone` runs the CORE bridge as a per-user
  # LaunchAgent (hooks + phone API + Codex). The cmux LIVE MIRROR is NOT covered
  # here — a launchd process can't drive the cmux control socket; for that, run
  # `cmux-iphone setup` with cmux present (it registers an in-cmux workspace).

      Next steps:
        cmux-iphone setup     # register Claude hooks + choose runner + print pairing code
        cmux-iphone doctor    # diagnostics

      cmux users: `cmux-iphone setup` runs the bridge inside cmux (live mirror).
      Without cmux you can instead: brew services start cmux-iphone

      After `brew upgrade cmux-iphone`, re-run `cmux-iphone setup` once so the
      LaunchAgent / cmux workspace re-point at the new version.
