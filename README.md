## How it works (two halves)

```
   iPhone / Watch  ──HTTP+SSE──►  cmux-iphone bridge (Node)  ──hooks──►  Claude Code
   (SwiftUI app)   ◄────────────  on your Mac                 ──RPC───►  cmux mirror
                                                              ──log───►  Codex
```

- **Bridge (Mac):** a small Node server (`cmux-iphone`) that receives Claude Code
  hook events, mirrors live cmux workspaces, watches Codex, and serves the phone
  over HTTP + Server-Sent Events. Discovered on the LAN via Bonjour.
- **App (iPhone + Watch):** a SwiftUI app that pairs with the bridge, shows live
  sessions/terminal output, and answers permission prompts.

Everything runs **on your own machines** — no cloud, no account, no server to host.
The bridge binds the LAN; a pairing code + per-device token are the auth boundary.
**Run it over Tailscale or a trusted LAN — it is not built to face the open internet**
(see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)).

> **cmux is optional.** With cmux installed you get the live workspace/terminal
> mirror; without it, the bridge still streams hook-based Claude/Codex sessions.

## Requirements

| Component | Minimum |
|-----------|---------|
| macOS | 13+ |
| Node.js | 18+ |
| Xcode | 16+ (to build the app) |
| iOS / watchOS | 17 / 10 |
| Claude Code | recent |
| cmux | optional, **0.63.2+** (uses cmux's `mobile.*` RPC) |
| Tailscale | optional (remote access) |

---

## Install — the Mac bridge

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install lim-won/tap/cmux-iphone
cmux-iphone setup
```

`brew upgrade cmux-iphone` updates it; re-run `cmux-iphone setup` once afterward so
the LaunchAgent / cmux workspace re-point at the new version.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lim-won/cmux-iphone && cd cmux-iphone/skill/bridge
npm ci                        # reproducible install (use `npm install` if no lockfile)
npm link                      # optional: puts `cmux-iphone` on your PATH
cmux-iphone setup             # or: node bin/cmux-iphone.js setup
```

`cmux-iphone setup` is **idempotent** (safe to re-run). It:

1. checks macOS + Node 18+, detects Claude/Codex/cmux/Tailscale,
2. writes `config.json` and generates secrets (`0600`, never rotated on re-run),
3. **backs up** `~/.claude/settings.json` and merges Cmux iPhone's hooks (scoped —
   it never touches another tool's hooks),
4. picks a runner — **in-cmux** when cmux is present (so the live mirror works), or
   a **LaunchAgent** when it isn't,
5. health-checks the bridge and prints your LAN/Tailscale address + pairing code.

> **Why two runners?** A `launchd` process cannot reach the cmux control socket
> (verified). So when cmux is present the bridge runs *inside* a cmux workspace;
> otherwise it runs as a LaunchAgent serving hook/phone/Codex sessions only.

### Using the cmux mirror

For the live cmux mirror, **cmux must be running and its control socket
reachable** when you run setup (configure cmux's socket password if it uses one).
Then:

```bash
cmux-iphone setup --cmux     # fails fast if cmux RPC isn't reachable (instead of half-installing)
cmux-iphone doctor           # confirm:  cmux RPC = mobile.workspace.list OK
```

If cmux is installed but its socket isn't reachable, setup stops and tells you —
it won't silently start a bridge that can't mirror. To skip cmux entirely and run
hook/phone/Codex sessions only: `cmux-iphone setup --launchd`.

Manage it with the CLI:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cmux-iphone setup` | install / repair (idempotent) |
| `cmux-iphone doctor` | read-only diagnostics — **paste this into a GitHub issue** |
| `cmux-iphone status` | bridge state, LAN/Tailscale address, cmux, paired devices |
| `cmux-iphone pair` | show the pairing code · `--list` · `--revoke <id>` |
| `cmux-iphone logs` | tail the LaunchAgent log (for an in-cmux bridge, open the **Agent Bridge** workspace) |
| `cmux-iphone restart` | restart the bridge |
| `cmux-iphone uninstall` | remove hooks + service (`--purge` also deletes data) |

## Install — the iPhone / Watch app (build it yourself)

There is **no App Store / TestFlight build** — Cmux iPhone is distributed as
source and you build it with your own free Apple ID. (TestFlight requires a paid
Apple Developer Program; a public binary may come later if the project enrolls.)

**1. Set your bundle id** (one command — no XcodeGen needed; the iPhone id, the
Watch id, and the Watch's companion id all derive from it):

```bash
./scripts/configure-ios.sh com.yourname.cmuxiphone
open ios/CmuxiPhone/CmuxiPhone.xcodeproj
```

**2. Add your Apple ID to Xcode:** Xcode → Settings → Accounts → **+** → Apple ID
(a free account works).

**3. Set the Team on BOTH targets:** select the project → for **CmuxiPhone** and
**CmuxiPhoneWatch**, Signing & Capabilities → *Automatically manage signing* →
**Team = your Personal Team**. (The bundle ids are already set by step 1.)

**4. Enable Developer Mode on the iPhone (iOS 16+):** Settings → Privacy &
Security → **Developer Mode** → On → restart. (Do the same on the Watch if
deploying to it: Watch app / watchOS Settings → Privacy & Security.)

**5. Run:** plug in your iPhone (with the Watch paired), pick the **CmuxiPhone**
scheme + your iPhone as the destination → **Run** (⌘R). For the Watch app, pick
the **CmuxiPhoneWatch** scheme and the paired-Watch destination (deploy via the
iPhone if direct watch install fails).

**6. Trust the developer cert:** on the iPhone, Settings → General → VPN & Device
Management → tap your developer profile → **Trust**.

> **Free-team limits:** the app expires ~**7 days** after building (re-run from
> Xcode to refresh), **no push notifications** (local notifications only), max 3
> devices. SideStore/AltStore can auto-refresh the *iPhone* app wirelessly.
>
> Maintainers: the project is generated from `project.yml` with `xcodegen` — only
> needed if you change the project structure; end users use the script above.

### Pair

1. Open the app → enter the **pairing code** (see below) + the Mac's address
   (`cmux-iphone status` shows the LAN and Tailscale addresses).
2. Same Wi-Fi → the bridge is also auto-discovered (Bonjour), so you can skip
   typing the address. Across networks, use the **Tailscale address** so the
   same pairing works whether you're in the office or away.

Each device gets its **own token**; revoke any of them with
`cmux-iphone pair --revoke <id>` (see `cmux-iphone pair --list`).

#### Where do I get the pairing code?

You don't need to be a developer — it's two commands at most:

- **At install,** `cmux-iphone setup` prints your code (and the addresses) at the
  end. It generates **one stable code per Mac** and saves it — it does **not**
  keep changing, so you can reuse it.
- **Anytime later,** run `cmux-iphone pair` to show it again.

```text
$ cmux-iphone pair
Pairing code: ******
Enter this code in the Cmux iPhone app on your iPhone.
```

> **Choose your own code (optional):** set `CMUX_IPHONE_PAIR_CODE=123456` in the
> bridge's environment to pin a memorable code. The code is the pairing gate
> (rate-limited — 5 tries per 5 min — and each device still gets its own token), so
> keep it private. Trusted LAN or Tailscale use is recommended; do not expose the
> bridge directly to the public internet.

> **Rotating code (optional):** prefer a code that rotates over a fixed one? Run
> `cmux-iphone setup --rotating` — a fresh 6-digit code each restart (24h TTL,
> cleared once a device pairs) instead of the stable per-Mac default.

> **Watch approvals (beta):** the Watch *shows* approvals but you answer them on
> the iPhone for now.

---

## Troubleshooting

Run **`cmux-iphone doctor`** first — it prints a PASS/WARN/FAIL report (no
secrets) that's ideal to paste into an issue.

- **iPhone "Connection failed":** run `cmux-iphone status` to get the bridge's
  **actual address + port** (it may bind another port in 7860–7869, or a non-loopback
  interface), then probe `/health` there — e.g. `curl http://<addr>:<port>/health`
  (note: `/status` requires auth). Bridge + phone must share the LAN (or Tailscale).
- **No cmux workspaces:** cmux only mirrors when the bridge runs *inside* cmux
  (`cmux-iphone status` shows the runner). Without cmux you still get hook sessions.
- **Watch/phone can't find the bridge (Bonjour):** check, in order — the app's iOS
  **Local Network** permission; both devices on the **same network**; the router's
  **AP / client isolation** is off; **mDNS isn't blocked**; then fall back to entering
  the **IP manually** (from `cmux-iphone status`).
- **Permission prompts don't appear:** confirm hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`
  and that a device is paired (`cmux-iphone pair --list`).

## How it works

### Event flow (Mac → phone)
Claude Code runs a tool → a `PostToolUse`/`PreToolUse` hook POSTs to the bridge →
the bridge pushes an SSE event → the app renders it.

### Permission flow (Mac → phone → Mac)
Claude hits a permission prompt → the `PermissionRequest` hook **blocks** → the
bridge pushes a `permission-request` SSE event → the phone shows the options →
your choice is POSTed back → the bridge returns the decision to Claude.
(For codex exec-approvals, the bridge types the answer into the *pinned* cmux
terminal, guarded by a screen hash — it refuses if the screen changed.)

Hooks installed (loopback listener, secret-gated): `PostToolUse`, `PreToolUse`,
`PermissionRequest` (blocking, up to 10 min), `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`,
`Stop`, error events.

---

## Security

By default the bridge listens on `0.0.0.0:<port>` (LAN-reachable); set `bindAddress`
(or the `HOST` env) to restrict it to a Tailscale/loopback interface. Auth is the
pairing code + per-device token; the hook listener is loopback-only and secret-gated.
Secrets live outside the repo at `0600`. Trusted LAN or Tailscale use is recommended —
do not expose the bridge directly to the public internet. Full model + reporting in
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
